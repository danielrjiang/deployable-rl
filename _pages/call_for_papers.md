### Topics of Interest
We invite contributions on theory and practice of RL aimed at facilitating deployment to real-world problems, examples of which include but are not limited to:
* __Methods to enable deployability in RL:__ offline RL, offline policy evaluation (OPE), offline to online RL, safe learning and exploration, preference learning, learning in partially observable settings, interpretabe policies in high-stakes settings, and methods for improving deployment efficiency.
* __Applications in personalization and recommendation systems:__ applications of RL and CB methods in technology platforms that interact with humans (e.g., audio and video recommendations, online advertising, LLMs).
* __Applications in industrial automation__: applications of RL and CB methods in the control of physical systems or allocation of resouces (e.g., inventory management, ride-sharing, commercial cooling systems, data center congestion control).
* __Applications in decision systems for healthcare:__ applications of RL and CB methods in healthcare (e.g., managing chronic conditions, digital treatment recommendations, human-in-the-loop RL).

The above are only a handful of suitable topics. We welcome submissions on any topic that focuses on the RL deployment process.
<br>

### Guidelines

* We welcome papers __between 4 and 8 pages__, excluding references/appendices. The length of the paper should be commensurate with its contribution. Both short and long papers are welcomed.
  * The paper should be in our version of the RLC workshop format ([Overleaf link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wzvmzpbnypvz#c13151)).
  * You may use as many pages of references and appendix as you wish, but reviewers are not required to read the appendix. 
* The review process will be <b>double-blind</b> and therefore, papers should be <b>anonymized</b>.
* Accepted papers are not considered an archival publication and there will not be workshop proceedings. Submissions that are concurrently under review at other venues are therefore allowed (assuming dual-submission and anonymity policies of other venues are not violated).
* All accepted papers will be presented as posters and will be made available on the workshop website.
